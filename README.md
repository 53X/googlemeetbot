# googlemeetbot
A simple Google meet bot so the bot can attend classes for you.(fuck the education system)
 
## REQUIREMENTS
      $ pip3 install selenium
      $ pip3 install pause
      $ pip3 install pynput
  I encourage you to work on a virtual enviornment like anaconda
  
### My Test Cases

* Firstly I work with with the selenium chrome-driver and uses chromium as the interface =  WORKS 
* Secondly I tested on a headless chrome = BUG 
* Mozilla headless driver works fine in mozilla firefox = WORKS

## Advantages of headless drivers?
   
   The program runs in background until you have a good internet connection and power . It never requires mozilla tab to be   opened
